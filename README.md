# AZOR CSDC100 Pre-Finals Gen AI Website
A Gen AI FAQs, Ethical Usage, and Analogy Website created as the Pre-Final Output of Mr. Azor.

This Website has a Home Page, FAQs Page, Ethics Page, and Analogy Page about Gen AI including the references/sources used by the creator.
The website wil start in the home page and it can be easily navigate by the user as it provides a navigation bar at the top part of  each webpage.

I used Bootstrap and manual css & js for this website.
