         You are organizing your wedding, the documentation team is asking 40k for the wedding package. They will use an Iphone 16 pro max to cover the event and CapCut for the same day edit video. The documentation team has 2 years of experience and has an above average portfolio. Would you agree to that deal? Explain your answer and justify the integrity of their work. Reflect on the integrity, creativity, skill level of the “vibe” coders.

    <p class="lead fade-in">
      My answer for this scenario would be, no. I will not agree to the initial price of the wedding package since the price is too much when the docu team will only use a smartphone and a simple editing app that most of the people can use and navigate easily. In terms of the integrity of their work, I am doubting if they are any good since they only use simple device and application with a job that requires a lot of skills and expertise
      which clearly does not match with the services that they are offering. Regarding their creativity and skills, I can compare them to "vibe-coders" since they use easily accessible equipments for their service and since we are talking about photography, videography, and editing, I think that their price does not match their service and creativity. In their line of
      work, they really need high-level creativity and skills. They may be similar to "vibe-coders", however, coding and digital photography is not the same and I think that photography on its own shall contain human creativity and authenticity far more than creating a code/program.
