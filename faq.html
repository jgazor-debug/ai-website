                1. What is Generative AI?

                    <li>Generative AI, sometimes called gen AI, is artificial intelligence (AI) that can create original content such as text, images, video, audio or software code in response to a user’s prompt or request.

Generative AI relies on sophisticated machine learning models called deep learning models algorithms that simulate the learning and decision-making processes of the human brain. These models work by identifying and encoding the patterns and relationships in huge amounts of data, and then using that information to understand users' natural language requests or questions and respond with relevant new content.</li>

                    <li>Generative AI models use neural networks to identify the patterns and structures within existing data to generate new and original content.

One of the breakthroughs with generative AI models is the ability to leverage different learning approaches, including unsupervised or semi-supervised learning for training. This has given organizations the ability to more easily and quickly leverage a large amount of unlabeled data to create foundation models. As the name suggests, foundation models can be used as a base for AI systems that can perform multiple tasks. 

Examples of foundation models include GPT-3 and Stable Diffusion, which allow users to leverage the power of language. For example, popular applications like ChatGPT, which draws from GPT-3, allow users to generate an essay based on a short text request. On the other hand, Stable Diffusion allows users to generate photorealistic images given a text input.</li>

                    <li>Levelling the playing field - Gen AI can process and interpret human language in a conversational style, which allows it to generate contextually relevant responses to user prompts.</li>
                    <li>Organisational productivity - Gen AI can be fine-tuned for different domains, so it can be made widely available for a variety of tasks. Some examples include chatbots, content generation and language translation. </li>
                    <li>Personalisation - Gen AI models can remember previous interactions, which results in more coherent and relevant conversation experiences for users.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The output of generative AI can be biased - As with other AI models, generative AI models are trained on data sets and when this data contains bias it is reflected in the output of the model.</li>
                    <li>The output of generative AI can be inconsistent - This can happen more frequently than some other AI-based outputs. When provided the same input, outputs can vary quite significantly due to the statistical nature of the models.</li>
                    <li>The output of generative AI can be inaccurate - Generative AI can help spread misinformation. Part of this is due to the potential of models to “hallucinate” ie to create false data and confidently rely on it. The current iteration of text-based generative AI models can be easily led, can make up quotes and references, and even contradict themselves when challenged, meaning they are not always a reliable source of truth.</li>
                    <li>The output of generative AI may not reflect the real world - Generative AI models can also struggle in fast-paced environments where up-to-date knowledge is critical, as the weighting of training data will invariably be towards older and potentially redundant information.</li>
                    <li>Generative AI can be used to create realistic looking fake images, audio and videos. These are sometimes known as deepfakes - Generative AI can increase the likelihood of fraud, as well as economic and organised crime.</li>
                    <li>Use of public generative AI tools may breach data privacy and security requirements - As a user of a public model, it can be difficult to have control over how data that you input into the model will be used and how access to it will be controlled.</li>
                    <li>Use of generative AI tools may breach copyright and intellectual property requirements - Generative AI foundation models use a large amount of data, some of which may be subject to intellectual property (IP) protection.</li>
                    <li>Determining responsibility and accountability can be difficult - The issue of how to determine responsibility and accountability when a generative AI model goes wrong can be a real challenge, particularly when it comes to foundation models such as LLMs.</li>

                    <li>How is Generative AI different from traditional data science? - Generative AI goes beyond traditional data science by creating new content, such as text, code, and synthetic data. While traditional data science focuses on structured data, statistical models, and generating explainable insights, Generative AI excels at creating content from unstructured data and is well-suited for creative, open-ended problems.</li>
                    <li>Why is Generative AI becoming so prominent now? - Generative AI is experiencing a significant surge in prominence. In 2024, 65% of organizations were using Generative AI, a 17% increase in adoption from the previous year across various sectors. Experts project the market will reach $1.8 trillion by 2030, with 67% of organizations expecting to increase their investment in AI over the next three years. Jensen Huang, CEO of NVIDIA, has stated that AI will be the most transformative technology of the 21st century.</li>
                    <li>What is prompt engineering? - A prompt is the starting point for generating AI responses. Simply put, a prompt is just a way of telling the AI what task you want it to perform, like asking it a question or giving it an instruction.</li>
                    <li>Applications of Gen AI for everyday use - GenAI can help us innovate by creating fresh content, discovering trends and extracting insights from data, summarizing information efficiently, and automating solutions and processes.</li>
